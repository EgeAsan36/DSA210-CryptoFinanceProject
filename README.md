## Project Overview

Through an analysis of their performance metrics, behavior, and reactions to macroeconomic events, this project seeks to understand how cryptocurrency markets relate to traditional financial markets. I try to comprehend how these various financial ecosystems interact with one another by comparing their risk profiles, volatility trends, and correlation dynamics.

I'll investigate trends in market correlations, volatility patterns, and the effects of outside economic factors on various asset classes using data analysis and visualization. Offering data-driven insights that can aid in comprehending the changing dynamic between the conventional and cryptocurrency markets is the aim.

## Motivation

The integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial environment poses intriguing analytical challenges, which is why I am working on this project. Understanding how digital assets behave in comparison to traditional assets is becoming more and more crucial as they continue to garner widespread attention for a number of reasons.

- **Investment Diversification**: Building more robust portfolios can be facilitated by comprehending correlation patterns between traditional and cryptocurrency assets.
- **Risk Management**: Better risk assessment is made possible by recognizing how various asset classes react to economic developments.
- **Market Evolution**: Monitoring the development of cryptocurrency markets in comparison to more established financial systems offers insights into their long-term integration.

We can go beyond conjecture and offer fact-based insights into the interactions and influences between these markets by conducting a quantitative analysis of these relationships.

## Data Sources

I plan to collect data from the following sources:

### Cryptocurrency Data
- **CoinGecko API**: Historical price data for top cryptocurrencies by market cap, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others
- **Binance Historical Data**: OHLCV data, trading volumes and market depth information
- **CoinMarketCap API**: Market capitalization and trading volume data

### Traditional Market Data
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Stock indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ, DJIA), ETFs, and commodity prices
- **FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)**: Interest rates, bond yields, inflation rates
- **World Bank Open Data**: Global economic indicators and financial statistics

### Supplementary Data Sources
- **Social Media Sentiment**: Twitter API, Reddit data (from relevant investing and cryptocurrency subreddits)
- **Google Trends**: Search interest data for cryptocurrencies and traditional market terms
- **News Headlines**: Financial news APIs and economic calendar data

I will collect these datasets using Python APIs and web scraping techniques where necessary(After I learn it), ensuring data is properly cleaned and aligned by timestamp for accurate comparison.

## Research Questions

This project seeks to answer the following key questions:

1. **Is there a significant correlation between cryptocurrency markets and traditional financial markets?**
   

2. **How do macroeconomic indicators differently impact crypto and traditional markets?**
  

3. **Does the volatility of crypto markets show convergence toward traditional markets over time?**


4. **How does social media sentiment differently influence crypto vs. traditional assets?**
   

5. **What are the risk-return profiles of various asset classes, and how do they compare?**
  
## Methodology

I will approach this analysis through several complementary methods:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics of price movements and returns
- Time series visualization of different asset classes

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Rolling correlation coefficients between crypto and traditional assets
- Correlation heatmaps across asset classes

### 3. Volatility Analysis
- Comparison of volatility metrics (standard deviation, ATR, etc.)

### 4. Sentiment Analysis
- Basic NLP techniques to quantify market sentiment from social media and news
- Correlation between sentiment indicators and price movements

### 5. Machine Learning Approaches
- Regression models to identify influential factors on asset prices
- Classification models to predict market movements
- Feature importance analysis to determine key drivers

## Analysis Plan

The analytical process will follow these key steps:

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing


### Phase 2: Core Analysis


### Phase 3: Advanced Analysis and Modeling


### Phase 4: Synthesis and Reporting


## Timeline

Following the course schedule:

- **March 10**: Project proposal submission (this document)
- **April 18**: Complete data collection, cleaning, and exploratory analysis
- **May 23**: Finish model implementation and advanced analytics
- **May 30**: Final submission with complete analysis and findings
