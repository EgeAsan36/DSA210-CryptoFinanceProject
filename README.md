# DSA210-CryptoFinanceProject
Comparative analysis of cryptocurrency markets and traditional financial indicators. A data science project exploring correlations, volatility patterns, and macroeconomic influences across different asset classes. DSA210 Term Project.

## Project Overview

By contrasting their risk profiles, performance indicators, and reactions to macroeconomic developments, this research seeks to examine the connections between the crypto currency and conventional financial markets.

## Motivation

The integration of cryptocurrencies into the conventional financial environment poses intriguing analytical difficulties, which is why I am working on this project. Investors, legislators, and market participants can all benefit from knowing how these various asset classes behave in relation to one another.

## Data Sources

I plan to collect data from:
- Cryptocurrency price data --> CoinGecko API, Binance historical data
- Traditional market data --> Yahoo Finance API (stocks, ETFs, commodities)
- Economic indicators --> FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
- Social media sentiment --> Twitter, Reddit
- News headlines and event data

I will collect these datasets using Python APIs and web scraping techniques where necessary.

## Research Questions

1. Do traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency markets significantly correlate with one another?
2. What are the differences in the effects of macroeconomic indicators on traditional and cryptocurrency markets?
3. Over time, does the volatility of cryptocurrency markets exhibit a trend toward traditional markets?
4. How do social media sentiments affect cryptocurrency differently than they do traditional assets?
5. How do the risk-return profiles of different asset classes compare to one another?

## Methodology

I will approach this analysis through:
- Using exploratory data analysis of price movements and relationships.
- Analyzing correlations between various market conditions
- Modeling and comparing volatility
- Analyzing time series to find trends and connections
- Predicting market behaviors using machine learning models

## Timeline

Following the course schedule:
- March 10: Project proposal (this document)
- April 18: Data collection, cleaning, and exploratory analysis
- May 23: Machine learning model implementation
- May 30: Final submission
